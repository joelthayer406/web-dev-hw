<h3>Why I chose this?</h3>
<p> Honestly I chose this because I had no other ideas so I am positive this is coming across as very uninspired so I am sorry about that. I use twitter quite a bit so that is where the idea came from. </p>

<p>If you were to look into more information on the subject directly I would go to Twitter directly.</p>
