  He looked over at Zero sleeping near him. Zero's face was lit in the starlight, and there was a flower petal in front of his nose that moved back and forth as he breathed. It reminded Stanley of something out of a cartoon. Zero breathed in, and the petal was drawn up almost touching his nose. Zero breathed out, and the petal moved toward his chin. It stayed on Zero's face for an amazingly long time before fluttering off to the side.</P>

<p><font face = "courier"
  size = "1" color = "#000000">Stanley considered placing it back in front of Zero's nose, but it wouldn't be the same.</p>

<p><font face = "courier"
  size = "1" color = "#000000">It seemed like Zero had lived at Camp Green Lake forever, but as Stanley thought about it now, he realized that Zero must have gotten there no more than a month or two before him. Zero was actually arrested a day later. But Stanley's trial kept getting delayed because of baseball.</p>

<p><font face = "courier"
  size = "1" color = "#000000">He remembered what Zero had said a few days before. If Zero had just kept those shoes, then neither of them would be here right now.</p>

<p><font face = "courier"
  size = "1" color = "#000000">As Stanley stared at the glittering night sky, he thought there was no place he would rather be. He was glad Zero put the shoes on the parked car. He was glad they fell from the overpass and hit him on the head.</p>

<p><font face = "courier"
  size = "1" color = "#000000">When the shoes first fell from the sky, he remembered thinking that destiny had struck him. Now, he thought so again. It was more than a coincidence. It had to be destiny.</p>
