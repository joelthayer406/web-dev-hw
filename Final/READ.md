13, 14, and 15: I learned a ton about web development during this class. I had no prior experience with any coding or anything like that. Github, Atom and coding in general were all different worlds to me. So just being able to make a webpage with some of my drawing on it was very cool to me. I do not know how much time I have spent working on these last three assignments, but it had to be over 30 hours during the last three days. They aren't perfect, but I am happy with how they turned out. That I was able to get the pages to go back and forth for the most part. That I was able to figure out how to make my pictures lay out side by side next to each other and not just in a singular vertical line.  This is very tough, the trial and error process is sometimes infuriating honestly. Not having my webpage update fast and having to wait 20-30 minutes to see if my changes did anything was something that I wish I knew how to work around. That definitely was a disadvantage. A lot of times I wanted to just give up but I am happy I finished everything. Hopefully everything I did was enough, I sure tried my best.
