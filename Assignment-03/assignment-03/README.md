Very briefly detail how browsers function. List any browsers you currently use to surf - or even develop for - the web.

Web Browsers use web language like HTML, CSS and JAVA Script that is then used by the browser to translate into an intended web design. I use google chrome and safari as my normal browsers.

What is a markup language? Describe one commonly used in development.

Markup Language is used as a way to process, define and present text on a webpage.
