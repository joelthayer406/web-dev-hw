<h3>Lyrics<h3>

  Yeah
(Eric)
Well
I don't need to lie no more

Nowadays all I do is shine, take a breath and ease my mind,

and, She don't cry no more
She tell me that I get her high 'cause a angel's s'posed to fly,

 and
I ain't askin', "Why?" no more
Oh, no, I take it if it's mine, I don't stay inside the lines

It ain't 2009 no more
Yeah, I know what's behind that door

Yeah, okay you gotta jump in to swim

Well, the light was dim in this life of sin

Now every day I wake up and breathe

I don't have it all but that's alright with me
Take it nice and easy, took a flight to see me

Send you back home with a light that's beamin'

The whole team 'bout to figure it out
We ice cold, that's what winter about

And sometimes, sometimes I wish I took a simpler route
Instead of havin' demons that's as big as my house, mhmm

Have a ball with a dribble and bounce
'Cause the party ain't over 'til they're kickin' me out,

yeah
Isn't it funny? We can make a lot of money

Buy a lot of things just to feel a lot of ugly
I was yay high and muddy

Lookin' for what was lookin' for me
But I don't need to lie no more

Nowadays all I do is shine, take a breath and ease my mind,

and she don't cry no more
She tell me that I get her high 'cause a angel's s'posed to fly,

and
I ain't askin', "Why?" no more
Oh, no, I take it if it's mine, I don't stay inside the lines
It ain't 2009 no more
Yeah, I know what's behind that door

Yeah, they ask me what I'm smilin' for
Well, because I've never been this high before

It's like I never felt alive before
Mhmm, I'd rather have me peace of mind than war

See me and you, we ain't that different
I struck the fuck out and then I came back swingin'

Take my time to finish, mind my business
A life ain't a life 'til you live it

I was diggin' me a hole big enough to bury my soul
Weight of the world, I gotta carry my own

My own, with these songs I can carry you home
I'm right here when you scared and alone

And I ain't never in a hurry
You don't ever gotta worry

Even when it's 7:30 and the time is runnin' low
When your heart get cold

See what's behind all them unturned stones
And I'm a pro when it come to my job

But really I'm just tryna start believin' in God

Now when it gets hard
I don't panic, I don't sound the alarm
Because I don't need to lie no more


Nowadays all I do is shine, take a breath and ease my mind, and
She don't cry no more
She tell me that I get her high 'cause a angel's s'posed to fly,

and
I ain't askin', "Why?" no more

Oh, no, I take it if it's mine, I don't stay inside the lines

It ain't 2009 no more
Yeah, I know what's behind that door

I don't need to lie no more

Nowadays all I do is shine, take a breath and ease my mind,

and She don't cry no more
She tell me that I get her high 'cause a angel's s'posed
to fly,

and I ain't askin', "Why?" no more
Oh, no, I take it if it's mine, I don't stay inside the lines

It ain't 2009 no more
Yeah, I know what's behind that door
