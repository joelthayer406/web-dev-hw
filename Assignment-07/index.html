<h3><center>2009 Lyrics<h3></div>

<p>Yeah Well I don't need to lie no more
Nowadays all I do is shine, take a breath and ease my mind,</p>

<p>and, She don't cry no more
She tell me that I get her high 'cause a angel's s'posed to fly,</p>

<p>and I ain't askin', "Why?" no more
Oh, no, I take it if it's mine, I don't stay inside the lines</p>

<p>It ain't 2009 no more
Yeah, I know what's behind that door</p>

<p>Yeah, okay you gotta jump in to swim
Well, the light was dim in this life of sin</p>

<p>Now every day I wake up and breathe
I don't have it all but that's alright with me</p>

<p>Take it nice and easy, took a flight to see me
Send you back home with a light that's beamin'</p>

<p>The whole team 'bout to figure it out
We ice cold, that's what winter about</p>

<p>And sometimes, sometimes I wish I took a simpler route
Instead of havin' demons that's as big as my house, mhmm</p>

<p>Have a ball with a dribble and bounce
'Cause the party ain't over 'til they're kickin' me out,</p>

<p>yeah, Isn't it funny? We can make a lot of money
Buy a lot of things just to feel a lot of ugly</p>

<p>I was yay high and muddy
Lookin' for what was lookin' for me</p>

<p>But I don't need to lie no more
Nowadays all I do is shine, take a breath and ease my mind,</p>

<p>and she don't cry no more
She tell me that I get her high 'cause a angel's s'posed to fly,</p>

<p>and I ain't askin', "Why?" no more
Oh, no, I take it if it's mine, I don't stay inside the lines</p>

<p>It ain't 2009 no more
Yeah, I know what's behind that door</p>

<p>Yeah, they ask me what I'm smilin' for
Well, because I've never been this high before</p>

<p>It's like I never felt alive before
Mhmm, I'd rather have me peace of mind than war</p>

<p>See me and you, we ain't that different
I struck the fuck out and then I came back swingin'</p>

<p>Take my time to finish, mind my business
A life ain't a life 'til you live it</p>

<p>I was diggin' me a hole big enough to bury my soul
Weight of the world, I gotta carry my own</p>

<p>My own, with these songs I can carry you home
I'm right here when you scared and alone</p>

<p>And I ain't never in a hurry
You don't ever gotta worry</p>

<p>Even when it's 7:30 and the time is runnin' low
When your heart get cold</p>

<p>See what's behind all them unturned stones
And I'm a pro when it come to my job </p>

<p>but really I'm just tryna start believin' in God
Now when it gets hard I don't panic, I don't sound the alarm</p>

<p>Because I don't need to lie no more
Nowadays all I do is shine, take a breath and ease my mind, and</p>

<p>She don't cry no more
She tell me that I get her high 'cause a angel's s'posed to fly,</p>

<p>and I ain't askin', "Why?" no more
Oh, no, I take it if it's mine, I don't stay inside the lines</p>

<p>It ain't 2009 no more
Yeah, I know what's behind that door</p>

<p>I don't need to lie no more
Nowadays all I do is shine, take a breath and ease my mind,</p>

<p>and She don't cry no more
She tell me that I get her high 'cause a angel's s'posed
to fly,</p>

<p>and I ain't askin', "Why?" no more
Oh, no, I take it if it's mine, I don't stay inside the lines</p>

<p>It ain't 2009 no more
Yeah, I know what's behind that door</p>

<p>I still do not understand why my webpage never contains any background colors I have. I think I am doing everything the videos say but it is hard to tell if i am just missing something. also videos seem to be copied the same as the videos but no luck with them loading in.</p>
