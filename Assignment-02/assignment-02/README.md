# Assignment 2
## Joel Thayer

I am taking Intro to Web Design because it is a requirement for me to graduate. I have always been scared of coding so I am hoping that I will slowy become at least comfortable with the idea of it. I really am trying to figure out the basics and hopefully from there I will learn stuff and succeed in the course. So far it has been a struggle but the website has been very helpful so far.

What I have learned so far and what I hope to learn.

I have learned the very basics of GitHub and Atom.

I have learned how to download packages into Atom.

I hope to become comfortable with using coding applications.
