Structural Markup: The elements of a code that you us for headings and paragraphs.

Semantic Markup: Is the extra information added to your code. Such as when you add emphasis or if you italicize something.

I felt more comfortable for this assignment and was not as confused straight out of the gate. Everything seemed to make sense as far as lists go and the setups. I am still having trouble entering htmls I think but for the most part I am happy with how this week went.
